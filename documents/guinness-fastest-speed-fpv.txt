The fastest ground speed by a battery-powered remote-controlled (RC) quadcopter is 480.23 km/h (298.47 mph), and was achieved by Luke Bell and Mike Bell (both South Africa), in Western Cape, South Africa, on 21 April 2024.

Luke has been flying drones for years and has an obsession with going fast.

The pair attempted the record by doing speed runs in opposite directions to negate the wind, going full throttle to reach the maximum propellor RPM.
